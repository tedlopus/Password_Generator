# Password_Generator
A random password generator.

- This random password generator allows you to create a password within the length of 8 and 128 characters.

- The password generator allows the user to create a password using numbers, special characters, lower and uppercase letters.

- The user is not required to use all of the criteria but it must include one special character.

- The user clicks the generate password and is prompted with a series of questions that allow the program to create a random password based off of the criteria they selected.

- This code uses css, html, and javascript to achieve the random password generator.

- The javascript uses functions that contain conditional statements (such as if and else statements) which filter through the all of the possible options that the user could select with the criteria.

- The math.random() function was utilized to help create the randomness in the password given the different arrays of criteria that could be selected.
